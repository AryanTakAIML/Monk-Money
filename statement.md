Problem Statement:

Managing daily expenses is difficult for students and individuals who lack a simple and visually clear financial tracking tool. Existing apps are often complicated, require sign-up, or lack transparency. Users need a minimal, fast, and clean way to monitor their income, expenses, and spending patterns.

Scope of the Project:
This project focuses on creating a lightweight personal finance management system using a modern web interface and a Flask + SQLite backend.

The scope includes:
A web-based tool accessible on any device
Ability to add, track, and manage income and expenses
Backend integration for permanent storage
Dashboard summarizing financial activity
Category-based visualization for better decision-making
Advanced features like authentication, cloud sync, or multi-user access are outside the scope for this version but may be added in future expansions.

Target Users:
The primary users of this system are:
Students managing monthly allowances
Young professionals tracking daily expenses
Individuals who want a simple, minimal money tracker
Beginners who want a clean financial overview without complex budgeting tools
